# Overview

I wanted to try and see if I could replicate RPG game's style of battles within the Arcade framework in Python. I wanted to try this because it was completely new to me, and I tend to enjoy games that has that style of gameplay, so I wanted to see if I could replicate it (at least as a proof-of-concept) using Python. 

The Player Sprite art does not belong to me, credits belong to RGG Studios, of SEGA.

# Development Environment

I used Microsoft VSCode to develop this project.

I used the Python programming language alongside the Arcade package.

# Useful Websites

Below is a list of websites that were helpful in the development of this project:

# Future Work

Below is a list of things I would like to add/change/improve upon:
* Turn indicators during battle, so it is easier to keep track of who's turn it is.
* Sounds or music
* More enemies
